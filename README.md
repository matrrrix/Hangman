# Hangman
A single player hangman game that handles all scenarios (that I know of haha). Uses the first character of an input as the letter guess.
To create wordbank.txt, I made a formatting algorithm in python because the word list I found online was separated by commas instead of separated by line. For kicks and giggles, I have provided the python file and the originalwordbank.txt as well.

NOTE: Enter your file path for wordbank.txt on line 12 of Hangman.java
